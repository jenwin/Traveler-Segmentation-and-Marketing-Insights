## Business Problem
How can a travel platform like Expedia identify distinct types of travelers to deliver personalized marketing campaigns that increase engagement, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction?

Understanding traveler behavior and segmenting users based on preferences, spending habits, and booking patterns allows travel companies to:

- Improve the effectiveness of marketing by targeting the right users with relevant offers
- Increase booking conversion rates through personalization
- Enhance customer experience and loyalty by tailoring promotions to match user needs
- Increase marketing effectiveness by identifying and reaching high-value or less-saturated audiences
